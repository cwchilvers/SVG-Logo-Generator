## Description
Generates SVG logo based on user input via the CLI. When creating a logo, the user is asked for:

* Logo text (maximum of 3 characters)
* Logo text color (from a list of colors)
* Logo shape (from a list of shapes)
* Logo shape color (from a list of colors)

For the logo text, all letters are changed to uppercase and any characters after the 3rd character are removed.
